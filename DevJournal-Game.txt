ft_transcendence DevJournal: Developing the game

1. Identifying the adequate tools
The goal was to find a way to implement a Pong game that was supposed to run in a browser.
Pong is based on graphics that are simplistic, but graphics nonetheless.
Thus, the first big task was to find a good way to render smooth graphics and embed them in HTML.
After some research, I discovered the "Canvas" element. Excerpt from Wikipedia:
"The canvas element is part of HTML5 and allows for dynamic, scriptable rendering of 2D shapes and bitmap images.
It is a low level, procedural model that updates a bitmap. HTML5 Canvas also helps in making 2D games."
This sounded perfect for the scope of Transcendence.

2. Creating a locally playable classic Pong
After discovering Canvas, I looked for a good tutorial and - conveniently enough -
I found an official Canvas tutorial for a classic brick-breaker-style game.
The tutorial only took a few hours to finish.
By the end of it, I had a fully functional game with a paddle, a ball and collisions.
This was as close as it could get to a Pong game, without actually being Pong.
The only changes I needed were adding one more controllable paddle, removing the bricks and adjusting the logic.
After another hour or two, I had a fully functional game of Pong that could be played by two players on the same keyboard.
The whole game was just one HTML file with around 200 lines of JavaScript code.

3. Getting creative
I had been having such a good time completing the game after starting from scratch in just 2 days,
that I wanted to experiment with the possibilities some more.
I wanted to add some special touches to the design of the game. So I added the gnome.
Making a static image appear on top of a moving ball for short periods of time
at random intervals along with a sound effect was a very encouraging start.
But I needed more.
